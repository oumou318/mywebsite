    <h1>Hello :)!! My Name is Oumou</h1>
    <p>I am a student at the wonderful <span>General Assembly</span> taking the Web Development Intensive course.I am striving to be a full-stack/ backend web developer</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I grew up and currently live in Harlem. I attended Hunter College. While there, I switched from major to major before deciding to stick with computer science.</p>
    <h3>My Road to here...</h3>
    <p>Everything happened so fast. My interest in the IT field started a few months ago, 10/2017. I was taking partime classes at Hunter college, working partime at Home Depot and getting my A+ certification at <span><a href="#">Npower</a></span>. After being certified, I interned at <span><a href="#">SCAN</a></span> for a help desk position. I became really interested in everything I was learning and wanted to learn more. So, I began to go to meetups. It was through the meetups that i heard about general assembly </p>
    <h3>Wait a minute...</h3>
    <p>After geting my A+ certification I wanted to persue more certifications.That road went sour for me and i stumbled upon Techimpact, a bridge program into General Assembly. Now, here I am learning to code and soon become a Web Developer!!!!!</p>
